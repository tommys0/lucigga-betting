## 🗄️ Database Migration Info Needed

To migrate from local SQLite to your external LibSQL server at `http://144.24.180.143:25569/`, I need the following information:

### Questions:

1. **Authentication:**
   - Does the server require an auth token?
   - If yes, what is the token?
   - Or is it an open HTTP connection?

2. **Database Access:**
   - Can you SSH into the server at `144.24.180.143`?
   - Do you have the LibSQL CLI installed on the server?
   - Can you run SQL commands directly?

3. **Database Type:**
   - Is this Turso (managed LibSQL)?
   - Or self-hosted LibSQL server?
   - What version of LibSQL?

4. **Schema Setup:**
   - Does the database already have tables?
   - Or do I need to create them from scratch?

### What I'll Need to Do:

Once you provide the info above, here's what I'll do:

1. **Option A: If you have SSH access**
   ```bash
   # I'll give you SQL commands to run on your server
   # You paste them into LibSQL CLI
   # Creates all tables (User, Player, Game, Bet)
   ```

2. **Option B: If it's Turso**
   ```bash
   # I'll update the connection to use Turso URL
   # Use `prisma db push` to sync schema
   # Much easier!
   ```

3. **Option C: If auth token exists**
   ```bash
   # Update .env with LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN
   # Test connection
   # Push schema
   ```

4. **Option D: If LibSQL HTTP API works**
   ```bash
   # Re-enable LIBSQL_URL in .env
   # Fix the adapter initialization
   # Migrate data from local to remote
   ```

### Files That Will Change:
- `.env` - Uncomment LIBSQL_URL, maybe add auth token
- `lib/prisma.ts` - Already configured, just needs to be enabled
- Database - Need to create tables on remote server

## 🔧 Testing the New Features

To test time-based betting locally without waiting for midnight:

**Temporary override for testing:**
In `app/components/LuckaBetting.tsx`, line 51, change:
```typescript
// FROM:
return hours >= 0 && hours < 8;

// TO (allow betting anytime for testing):
return true;

// OR TO (test specific hours):
return hours >= 14 && hours < 15; // 2-3 PM for testing
```

Don't forget to change it back when deploying!

## 📱 Mobile Access

The app still works as a PWA:
- Open on phone at `http://YOUR-NETWORK-IP:3000`
- Add to home screen
- Stay logged in for 30 days
- Bet each morning between midnight-8 AM

## 🎮 Daily Workflow

**Every School Day:**

**At night (midnight-8 AM):**
1. Students open app on phone
2. Each student places their bet
3. See leaderboard
4. Close app

**When Lucka arrives:**
1. Admin opens app
2. Enters actual time (slider)
3. Clicks "Reveal Results"
4. Everyone sees results on TV at `/players`

**Next day:**
1. Admin clicks "New Game"
2. Repeat!
