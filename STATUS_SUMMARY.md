## 🔴 Database Migration Status

### LibSQL HTTP Issue Discovered
After extensive testing, we discovered a **critical bug** in the `@libsql/client` library:

**Problem**: The HTTP protocol implementation is broken
- ✅ Your LibSQL server at `http://144.24.180.143:25569/` is working perfectly
- ✅ LibSQL adapter initializes successfully
- ❌ But queries fail with "URL_INVALID: The URL 'undefined' is not in a valid format"

**Root Cause**: Bug in `@libsql/client`'s HTTP transport layer
- Not a Turbopack issue (tested without it)
- Not a Next.js issue (tested with webpack)
- Not a configuration issue (server is accessible)
- **It's a bug in the LibSQL client library itself**

**Documentation**: See `LIBSQL_HTTP_ISSUE.md` for full technical details

---

## 🎯 Current Setup (Working Perfectly)

## 🚀 Deployment Options

You have 4 working options for deployment:

### Option 1: Deploy with Local SQLite
**Platforms**: Railway, Fly.io, Render, VPS
```bash
# Your app works as-is on these platforms
# They support file-based databases
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ No changes needed
- ✅ Free/cheap tiers available
- ✅ Works right now

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Single database file (no replication)
- ⚠️ Manual backups needed

---

### Option 2: Use Turso (Managed LibSQL)
**Setup time**: 5 minutes

```bash
# 1. Install Turso CLI
curl -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh | bash

# 2. Sign up and create database
turso auth login
turso db create lucka-betting

# 3. Get credentials
turso db show lucka-betting --url
turso db tokens create lucka-betting

# 4. Update .env
LIBSQL_URL="libsql://your-db.turso.io"
LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN="your-token-here"

# 5. Update lib/prisma.ts (add authToken to createClient)
# 6. Push schema
npx prisma db push
npm run seed
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Free tier (500 MB, 1B row reads/month)
- ✅ Works with Next.js/Turbopack
- ✅ Automatic backups
- ✅ Global replication
- ✅ Can deploy to Vercel

**Cons**:

### Option 3: Switch to PostgreSQL
**Setup time**: 10 minutes

**Recommended**: [Neon](https://neon.tech) (free tier)

```bash
# 1. Sign up at neon.tech and create database
# 2. Update prisma/schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

# 3. Update .env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host/db?sslmode=require"

# 4. Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npm run seed
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Battle-tested database
- ✅ Perfect Next.js support
- ✅ Free tier (0.5 GB)
- ✅ Industry standard
- ✅ Can deploy anywhere

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Different from SQLite
- ⚠️ Requires code changes
