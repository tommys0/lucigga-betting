2. Upload a simple image (clock emoji screenshot, purple gradient, etc.)
3. Generate and download icons
4. Rename them to:
   - `icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
   - `icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)
5. Place both files in `/public/` folder

### Option 2: Create Manually
Using any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.):

**icon-192.png:**
- Size: 192x192 pixels
- Background: Purple gradient (#581c87 to #be185d)
- Add: ‚è∞ emoji or "LB" text in white
- Save as PNG

**icon-512.png:**

### Quick Text-Based Icons
```bash
# Create simple colored squares (temporary solution)
